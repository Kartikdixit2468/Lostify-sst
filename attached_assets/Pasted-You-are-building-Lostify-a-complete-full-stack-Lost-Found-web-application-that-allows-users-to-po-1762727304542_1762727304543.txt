You are building Lostify, a complete full-stack Lost & Found web application that allows users to post, search, and manage lost or found items, while providing admins with full moderation and analytics control.

The app should be modern, responsive, and production-ready, using React (frontend), Express.js (backend), and Replit Database for persistent storage.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS

Backend: Express.js (Node.js)

Database: Replit Database

Auth: Secure JWT-based authentication

Password Hashing: bcrypt

Charts: Chart.js or Recharts for analytics

🧩 Core Features

User Authentication

Signup and Login using username, email, and password.

Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes.

JWT-based login sessions with auto-expiry.

No hardcoded secrets — use JWT_SECRET in Replit Secrets tab.

Post Lost or Found Items

Form fields: title, description, category, type (Lost/Found), location, date, contactNumber, imageURL.

Validate inputs and upload optional image via Replit Storage API or external URL.

Save each post in Replit Database with status: active by default.

Users can edit, delete, or mark posts as “Resolved.”

Browse & Search

Dynamic list of all active posts.

Filters: type (Lost/Found), category, location.

Search by title, description, or keyword.

Responsive card-based grid layout.

User Dashboard

Each user sees their own posts under “My Posts.”

Actions: edit, delete, or mark resolved.

Section for “My Matches” (items automatically matched by keyword similarity).

Admin Dashboard (Fully Functional)

Role-based login: admin credentials stored as environment variables (ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD).

Admin JWT token includes role: 'admin'.

Only admin can access /admin route or /api/admin/* APIs.

Admin Features:

Dashboard overview with statistics: total posts, active vs resolved, lost vs found count.

Data table with all posts (sortable and filterable).

Flagged posts queue (reported by users).

Edit, resolve, or delete any post.

Add admin notes for internal tracking.

Export posts as CSV.

Visual analytics using Chart.js (category distribution, posts per week).

Admin API Routes:

GET /api/admin/stats – returns post stats for dashboard.

GET /api/admin/posts – fetch all posts (with filters).

PATCH /api/admin/posts/:id – update post status or add notes.

DELETE /api/admin/posts/:id – remove post.

Smart Match System

Compare “Lost” and “Found” posts using string similarity between titles and descriptions.

Highlight likely matches in both users’ dashboards.

Optionally notify users when a strong match is found.

Security

JWT authentication middleware for all protected routes.

Role-based access control (user vs admin).

bcrypt for password hashing.

Input validation and sanitization for all forms.

Server fails gracefully if environment variables (JWT_SECRET, admin credentials) are missing.

UI & UX

Clean, modern TailwindCSS interface.

Light and dark mode support.

Sticky navbar with routes: Home, Lost, Found, Dashboard, Admin (only for admins).

Toast notifications for post creation, deletion, resolution, and errors.

Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.

🧱 Database Schema (Replit DB Structure)
users:<username> = {
  id,
  username,
  email,
  passwordHash,
  isAdmin (boolean)
}

posts:<uuid> = {
  id,
  userId,
  title,
  description,
  category,
  type, // Lost or Found
  location,
  date,
  contactNumber,
  imageURL,
  status, // active, resolved, flagged
  createdAt,
  adminNote (optional)
}

🔒 Security Highlights

All sensitive data stored in Replit Secrets.

JWT secret never hardcoded.

Automatic token validation on startup; expired sessions cleared.

Strict admin route protection.

Password hashing with bcrypt.

⚡ Optional Add-Ons (Stretch Goals)

Email or WhatsApp notifications when a match is found.

QR code for each post (scan to view details).

Reputation system (points for successful recoveries).

“Report Post” feature to flag suspicious entries.

Public leaderboard of verified finders.

🎯 Deliverables

Working full-stack app deployed on Replit.

Secure authentication and admin system.

Functional CRUD for posts.

Search, filter, and smart match functionality.

Polished responsive UI with TailwindCSS.

Clean code, comments, and documentation.

🧠 Instructions for Replit AI

Generate backend (Express) and frontend (React) folders with proper structure.

Implement JWT authentication with bcrypt and role validation.

Create REST APIs for posts, users, and admin routes.

Build responsive UI components for home, login, signup, dashboard, and admin pages.

Connect frontend to backend via Axios.

Deploy and test all endpoints and dashboards for full functionality.

End goal: A polished, secure, and data-driven lost-and-found platform where users can recover items efficiently and admins can manage and moderate all activity through an advanced analytics dashboard.
