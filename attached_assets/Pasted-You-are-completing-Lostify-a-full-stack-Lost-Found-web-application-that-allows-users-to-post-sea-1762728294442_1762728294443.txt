You are completing Lostify, a full-stack Lost & Found web application that allows users to post, search, and manage lost or found items, while providing admins with full moderation and analytics.

The platform must be modern, secure, and fully functional on Replit using:

Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS

Backend: Express.js (Node.js)

Database: Replit Database

Auth: JWT for sessions, bcrypt for password hashing

OAuth: Google login restricted to @sst.scaler.com emails

🧩 Core Functionality

User Authentication

Email + password signup/login.

Passwords hashed with bcrypt.

JWT-based sessions with auto-expiry and cookie storage.

Google OAuth login (only allow @sst.scaler.com domain).

Unauthorized Google accounts must see a clear toast error message:
“Only @sst.scaler.com accounts are allowed.”

Admin Login

Add an Admin tab on the same Sign In page.

Verify credentials against Replit Secrets (ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD).

On success, issue JWT with role: 'admin' and redirect to /admin.

Protect all /api/admin/* routes with role middleware.

Create Lost/Found Posts

Form fields: title, description, category, type (Lost/Found), location, date, contactNumber, and Add Image (file upload).

Replace “Image URL” with a file upload input.

On submit, upload image to backend /api/upload, validate file (jpg, png, jpeg, webp, ≤3MB), and return a stored URL.

Save to DB with status “active.”

Post Cards (UI updates)

Replace static image area with uploaded image or gray box + icon if no image.

Colored strip on left edge: red for “Lost,” green for “Found.”

Show date and time formatted as DD/MM/YYYY (hh:mm A).

Add Message Owner or Message Finder button at the bottom:

Opens WhatsApp chat via https://wa.me/<number>?text=Hi, I’m contacting you about "<item title>" on Lostify.

Validate numbers and convert to E.164 format (default +91).

Responsive grid layout with shadow and hover lift.

User Dashboard

Tabs: My Posts, My Matches, Profile.

Users can edit, delete, or mark posts as resolved.

Show match suggestions using keyword similarity between Lost and Found posts.

Admin Dashboard

Accessed only by users with role: 'admin'.

Features:

Total posts, active vs resolved count, lost vs found ratio.

Category distribution chart (Chart.js or Recharts).

Full table of all posts (sortable, filterable, paginated).

Flagged posts queue (reported by users).

Admin actions: delete, mark resolved, edit status, add internal notes.

Export posts as CSV.

Endpoints:

GET /api/admin/stats

GET /api/admin/posts

PATCH /api/admin/posts/:id

DELETE /api/admin/posts/:id

Search & Filters

Search bar filters by title, description, or keywords.

Filter by category, type, or location.

Sticky filters on mobile for better UX.

Backend Enhancements

POST /api/upload – handles file uploads using multer.

POST /api/posts – create post.

GET /api/posts – fetch posts (with filters + pagination).

PATCH /api/posts/:id – update or mark resolved.

DELETE /api/posts/:id – delete post.

POST /api/posts/:id/report – flag a post (moves to flagged queue after threshold).

Smart Matching

On post creation, run simple keyword similarity check (Lost vs Found) to suggest matches.

Highlight potential matches on both dashboards.

UI/UX & Responsiveness

Clean, modern Tailwind styling consistent across all pages.

Add empty states, skeleton loaders, and toasts for all actions.

Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile (no horizontal scroll).

Dark mode toggle.

✅ Acceptance Tests

Login with a normal user → create a Lost item with image → card shows image + formatted date/time.

WhatsApp button opens chat with correct message text.

Login as admin (from Sign In page → Admin tab) → see stats and posts → delete or mark resolved.

Google login with @sst.scaler.com → success.

Google login with another domain → rejected with toast “Only @sst.scaler.com accounts allowed.”

Responsive test: works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

All routes and sessions verified, secure, and persistent.

Goal: Deliver a polished, production-grade Lostify app — responsive, fully functional, secure, and connected — with real image uploads, admin control, WhatsApp messaging, and @sst.scaler.com-only Google login.
