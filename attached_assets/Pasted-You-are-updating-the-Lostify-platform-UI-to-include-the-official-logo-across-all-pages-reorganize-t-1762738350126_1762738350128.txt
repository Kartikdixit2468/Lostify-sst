You are updating the Lostify platform UI to include the official logo across all pages, reorganize the navigation bar with a profile dropdown menu, and ensure a consistent, modern layout in both user and admin views.

🖼️ 1. Add Lostify Logo Across the App

Goal:
Add the official Lostify logo (from the provided image) to every relevant page and component while maintaining proper scaling and alignment.

Tasks:

Import and use the provided logo image:

import logo from "./assets/lostify-logo.png"; // Adjust path as needed


Add logo to:

Navbar (top-left)

Login and Register pages

Admin panel header

Footer (small version)

Make the logo clickable, navigating back to the dashboard/home:

<img
  src={logo}
  alt="Lostify Logo"
  className="h-10 w-auto cursor-pointer"
  onClick={() => navigate("/")}
/>


Ensure responsive scaling:

Mobile: max height 32px

Desktop: max height 48px

Styling Guidelines:

Use object-contain and rounded-xl for clean rendering.

Add subtle hover animation using Framer Motion:

whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}


Dark Mode → invert colors if needed (via filter: invert(1)).

👤 2. Add Profile Icon + Dropdown (Settings + Logout)

Goal:
Add a profile icon at the top-right corner of the navbar for both user and admin roles.
When clicked, it should open a dropdown menu containing:

Profile (optional future use)

Settings

Logout

Implementation:

import { useState } from "react";
import { FaUserCircle } from "react-icons/fa";

const [menuOpen, setMenuOpen] = useState(false);

<div className="relative">
  <FaUserCircle
    className="text-3xl cursor-pointer text-[#F8C538]"
    onClick={() => setMenuOpen(!menuOpen)}
  />
  {menuOpen && (
    <div className="absolute right-0 mt-2 w-48 bg-[#E7ECEF] dark:bg-[#1E2A45] rounded-lg shadow-lg border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700">
      <button
        className="block w-full text-left px-4 py-2 hover:bg-[#F8C538] hover:text-[#1E2A45]"
        onClick={() => navigate("/settings")}
      >
        ⚙️ Settings
      </button>
      <button
        className="block w-full text-left px-4 py-2 hover:bg-[#F8C538] hover:text-[#1E2A45]"
        onClick={handleLogout}
      >
        🚪 Logout
      </button>
    </div>
  )}
</div>


Additional Notes:

Use the same component in both user and admin layouts for consistency.

The dropdown should close automatically when:

User clicks outside it (add useEffect listener)

User clicks one of the options.

Logout Logic:

const handleLogout = () => {
  localStorage.clear();
  navigate("/login");
  toast.success("Logged out successfully!");
};

🧭 3. Update Navbar Layout (User + Admin)

Goal:
Reorganize navbar to follow modern app structure.

Layout:

| [Logo] | [Navigation Tabs / Links] | [Dark Mode Toggle] [Profile Icon] |


Tasks:

Remove standalone “Settings” and “Logout” buttons (moved under profile dropdown).

Keep dark mode toggle as a small moon/sun icon beside profile icon.

For admin, maintain “ADMIN” badge beside the logo (yellow pill).

<span className="ml-2 bg-[#F8C538] text-[#1E2A45] text-xs font-semibold px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
  ADMIN
</span>


Responsive Design:

On smaller screens → collapse nav items into a hamburger menu.

Keep profile icon visible even on mobile.

🎨 4. Styling and Consistency

All dropdowns, hover effects, and icons must respect dark/light mode styles.

Use Lostify’s brand palette:

Navy #1E2A45 for dark mode backgrounds.

Yellow #F8C538 for highlights.

Light gray #E7ECEF for light mode cards.

Apply subtle Framer Motion transitions:

Dropdown fade/slide: initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -10 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}

🔁 5. Integration Summary
Feature	Added/Modified	Behavior
Logo	✅ Added	Appears in navbar, login, admin, and footer; clickable
Profile Icon	✅ Added	Top-right dropdown with settings + logout
Navbar Layout	✅ Updated	Clean structure, responsive, brand-aligned
Settings	✅ Moved	Into dropdown under profile icon
Logout	✅ Moved	Into dropdown under profile icon
Dark Mode	✅ Retained	Positioned beside profile icon
Admin Badge	✅ Retained	Beside logo, only for admin role
🧠 6. Optional Enhancements

Add user’s profile picture from OAuth (if available):

<img src={user.picture} className="h-8 w-8 rounded-full" />


Fallback to FaUserCircle if no image.

Add hover tooltips to icons (“Toggle Theme,” “Profile,” etc.).

Add small entry animation to dropdown (transition-all duration-200).

✅ 7. Final Result

After these changes:

Lostify logo appears consistently across all pages and acts as a home shortcut.

Navbar is compact, elegant, and mobile-friendly.

Settings and Logout are accessible from a clean dropdown under the profile icon.

All colors and transitions match Lostify’s design language.

🎯 Goal

Deliver a consistent, professional, and UX-optimized interface where:

The Lostify logo reinforces branding.

The top-right profile icon consolidates user actions.

Navigation feels minimal, modern, and intuitive.

Both light and dark modes remain visually balanced.
