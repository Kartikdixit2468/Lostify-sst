You are the Replit AI assistant helping build Lostify, a lost-and-found web application for college students.

The goal is to create a fully functional, production-ready full-stack app using React (frontend), Express.js (backend), and Replit Database for data persistence.

🎯 Objective

Build a complete lost-and-found portal where users can post lost/found items, browse others’ posts, mark items as returned, and manage their profile — all in real-time, from a clean and responsive UI.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS

Backend: Express.js (Node.js)

Database: Replit Database

Routing: React Router DOM

Auth: Simple username/password stored securely (hashed) in Replit DB

Hosting: Replit built-in deployment

🧩 Core Features

User Authentication

Sign up / login with username, password, email.

Store passwords hashed in Replit Database.

Session management via JWT or Replit Auth.

Post Item (Lost or Found)

Form with fields:

title, description, category (ID card, bag, mobile, etc.),

type (Lost / Found),

location,

date/time,

contactNumber,

imageURL (optional, upload to Replit storage or external link).

Client-side validation before submission.

Store data in Replit Database as structured objects.

Browse & Search Items

Public feed showing all active posts.

Filters: Lost/Found, category, location.

Search bar for keywords in title/description.

Pagination or infinite scroll.

User Dashboard / My Posts

Shows user’s submitted posts (Lost & Found).

Edit or delete own posts.

Option to mark items as “Resolved” (item returned or found).

Admin Dashboard

Admin login (flag stored in DB).

View all posts, filter by status, delete spam or fake entries.

Display total posts, active items, resolved items.

Notifications (Optional / Stretch Goal)

Basic matching logic: if a “Found” post title/description matches keywords from someone’s “Lost” post → show an alert or highlight potential matches.

Responsive UI & UX

Mobile-first design using TailwindCSS.

Simple navbar (Home, Lost, Found, My Posts, Profile).

Card-based layout for posts.

Loading skeletons, modals, and success/error toasts.

Data Persistence

Use Replit Database with clear key structure:

users:<username> -> { username, email, passwordHash, isAdmin }
posts:<id> -> { id, user, title, description, type, category, location, date, contact, imageURL, status }


Index posts for listing and searching efficiently.

Security

Hash passwords using bcrypt.

Verify JWT on protected routes (e.g., “My Posts”, Admin).

Deployment

Ensure both frontend and backend run on Replit.

Configure .replit and replit.nix for full-stack support.

Expose backend routes (/api/posts, /api/users, etc.) for frontend calls.

🔁 Workflow / Flow of the App

Landing Page

Shows hero section with “Report Lost Item” / “Report Found Item” buttons.

Displays recent posts preview.

Signup/Login

New user registers → stored in DB.

Authenticated users redirected to Dashboard.

Dashboard (After Login)

Tabs: All Posts | My Posts | Add New

“Add New” opens form modal → submits via /api/posts/create.

“My Posts” lets user edit, delete, or mark resolved.

Public Feed

All users (even guests) can view posts and use filters/search.

Clicking a post opens details page with contact info.

Admin View

Restricted route.

View all posts, manage spam, and track platform activity metrics.

Logout

Clear token/session → redirect to landing page.

🧠 Instructions for Replit AI

Generate backend and frontend boilerplate with above structure.

Implement user auth with password hashing and Replit Database.

Create REST API routes for CRUD operations on posts.

Connect frontend pages with backend via Axios calls.

Implement state management (Context API or simple hooks).

Add Tailwind components for forms, cards, modals, and navbar.

Test all workflows end-to-end (signup → post item → edit → resolve → admin view).

Deploy live on Replit.

✅ Deliverables:

Fully working lost & found app

Persistent Replit DB data

Clean UI

Working auth, CRUD, search, filters

Admin dashboard and responsive design
