You are finalizing and upgrading the Lostify platform to include advanced filtering and direct contact email functionality for admin feedback.

🧾 Contact Form Mailing

The existing contact modal should send the submitted message directly to the admin’s email.

Add backend route /api/contact:

Validates required fields: name, email, and message.

Uses Nodemailer with credentials stored in Replit Secrets:

ADMIN_EMAIL

ADMIN_APP_PASSWORD (Gmail app password or equivalent)

Sends formatted email:

Subject: [Lostify Feedback] <subject or "General Message"> from <name>
Body:
Name: <name>
Email: <email>
Message:
<message>


Responds with success or error JSON.

Show toast on success (“Message sent successfully!”) and error (“Failed to send message.”).

Keep styling consistent with dark/light modes.

🧭 Filter System (User & Admin)
For All Users:

Add detailed filters to Browse and My Posts:

Type (Lost/Found)

Category (Electronics, ID Cards, Books, Accessories, Wallets, Others)

Location (dropdown/search)

Date Range (From–To)

Sort By (Newest, Oldest, Recently Updated, Resolved)

Each filter dynamically updates results (no reload) with debounce (300ms).

Add “Clear Filters” button.

For Admins:

Extend with:

Status (Active, Resolved, Flagged)

User Email / Name (search)

Has Image (checkbox)

🎨 Design & Interaction

Filter panel:

Desktop: sidebar on left.

Mobile: collapsible top panel via “Filter” button.

Use Lostify brand palette:

Light Gray #E7ECEF (light mode surface)

Navy #1E2A45 (dark mode surface)

Yellow #F8C538 (highlight)

“Apply” → btn-primary, “Clear” → btn-secondary.

Framer Motion animations on filter transitions and result updates.

🧾 Lost/Found Form Validation

Required fields: Title, Category, Description, Type, Location, Date (no future dates), Contact Number.

Optional: Image Upload, Additional Notes.

Mark required fields with red asterisk *.

Inline error text for missing or invalid inputs.

🧠 Quality Check

Test contact form successfully sends an email to ADMIN_EMAIL.

Validate all form inputs client-side and server-side.

Confirm filters work dynamically, persist via URL or localStorage.

Check responsive layouts and dark/light theme consistency.

Ensure no personal identifiers (e.g., “Scaler student”) appear outside footer credit.

Goal: Finalize Lostify as a fully operational, feedback-ready, and user-centered platform with dynamic filters, validated forms, and a direct communication channel between users and admin via email.
