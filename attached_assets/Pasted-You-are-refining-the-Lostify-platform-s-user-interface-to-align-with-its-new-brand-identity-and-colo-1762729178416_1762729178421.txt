You are refining the Lostify platform’s user interface to align with its new brand identity and color system.
Implement the design, color, and layout consistency improvements listed below, fix the dark mode toggle, and ensure all UI components follow the unified style guide.

🎨 Apply the Official Lostify Color Theme

Primary Colors:

Navy (Primary): #1E2A45

Yellow (Accent): #F8C538

Light Gray (Surface): #E7ECEF

Charcoal (Text): #1A1A1A

White (Base): #FFFFFF

Green (Found): #10B981

Red (Lost): #EF4444

Apply globally:

Backgrounds → Light gray or white in light mode, navy in dark mode.

Buttons → Primary navy background with white text; hover: yellow background with navy text.

Lost tag → soft red background, white text.

Found tag → soft green background, white text.

Navbar/footer → navy background with yellow highlights.

Inputs → gray borders and subtle focus glow matching accent color.

🌗 Fix Dark Mode Toggle

Ensure Tailwind darkMode: 'class' is enabled.

Implement a useDarkMode() hook that toggles the class dark on document.documentElement.

Store user preference in localStorage.

On page load, check localStorage and apply the correct theme.

Add a smooth 0.3s transition for background and text color changes.

🧱 Typography & Spacing

Import and apply:

Headings & Buttons → Manrope, 600–700 weight.

Body & Labels → Inter, 400–500 weight.

Consistent font sizing scale:

H1: 2rem

H2: 1.5rem

Body: 1rem

Use uniform spacing (Tailwind spacing scale 4, 8, 12, 16).

🪄 Components to Update

Include a button to create new posts.

Toasts & Feedback

Success → green, Error → red, Info → yellow.

🧠 Functional Checks

Verify dark mode toggle persistence.

Ensure color theme propagates across all components and pages.

Test all hover/focus states for accessibility.

Make sure light and dark mode both maintain visual contrast and readability.

Goal: Deliver a cohesive, branded, and responsive Lostify UI that reflects the new color palette, fixes the dark mode toggle, and maintains a modern, accessible user experience across all devices.
